Library used:
https://github.com/vergeman/aws-sdk-for-java-on-gae

(forked from https://github.com/apcj/aws-sdk-for-java-on-gae)
the library is somewhat old and doesn't have new updates - especially
for spot prices; so had to fork and update to reflect some changes 
from aws.


build to get build/classes/gae-aws-sdk-1.1.7.1.jar and copy to CloudEx
